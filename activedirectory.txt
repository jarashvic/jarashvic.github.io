		admin
		Pa$$w0rd

2.	Use VMWare Workstation Player to create a VM.
	Use default settings.

2.5	On the command line:  ncpa.cpl


3.	Assign an IP address, a subnet mask, a default
	gateway and two DNS Server IP addresses:

	For example:	192.168.1.X	
			255.255.255.0		
			192.168.1.3 <------  default gateway
			192.168.1.X <------  first DNS IP
			8.8.8.8     <------  second DNS IP

4.	Start the Windows 7 VM and assign IP, SM, DG and DNS.

			192.168.1.3 <------  default gateway
			192.168.1.X <------  first DNS IP

5.	Verify connectivity by pinging the Windows Server FROM
	the Windows 7 VM.
